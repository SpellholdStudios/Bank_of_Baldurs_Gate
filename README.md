## <a name="intro" id="intro"></a>Overview

The main idea of this mod is a thought, that often player is left without money. And it's stupid that there is not a single bank in the big city of Baldur's Gate. So I wrote this mod.

<details><summary>&#160;&#160;:warning: spoiler</summary>
<p>

###### before going against Crusade and after being judged for Skie's killing, and after abduction by Jon Irenicus.
</p>
</details><br>

Near the Iron Throne Headquarters, there is a locked dwelling with ogre magi inside. This is the Ducal Bank of Baldur's Gate, that was blocked due to robbing by ogres. After you kill the ogre magi, you may return after one day passed, and find that bank returned to work. Go to second floor and open an account by talking to director Billboo. :wink: You can deposit or withdraw your money at any time.
 
Director will be waiting for you near bank after initial happenings of Siege of Dragonspear, so you can withdraw your money from your account if needed.

:warning: in BG2 campaign, if you want to go to the bank and retrieve your money, you need to install a separate mod that enables visiting Baldur's Gate city after BG2 part started.

## <a name="compat" id="compat"></a>Compatibility

#### Games supported

This mod is designed to work on <a href="https://github.com/Gibberlings3/EET/releases">Enhanced Edition Trilogy</a> (EET).

## 

#### Other Mods Compatibility

This is a WeiDU mod, and therefore should be compatible with all WeiDU mods. Though I am striving to make Bank of Baldur's Gate compatible with as many other mods as possible, there is always a chance that incompatibilities will arise. If you encounter any bugs, please <a href="http://www.shsforums.net/topic/60019-mod-bank-of-baldurs-gate-for-eet/">report them on the mod forum!</a>

## 

#### Installation Order

Here is the recommended installation order:
- Please install Bank of Baldur's Gate after BG2 Fixpack, and EET.
- Please install Bank of Baldur's Gate before EET_End, and any final "biffing" routines.

## <a name="installation" id="installation"></a>Installation

#### Notes

*If you've previously installed the mod, remove it before extracting the new version. To do this, run __setup-bank_of_baldurs_gate.exe__, un-install all previously installed components and delete the :file_folder: __bank_of_baldurs_gate__ folder.*

*When installing or un-installing, __do not close the DOS window__ by clicking on the __X__ button! Instead, press the __Enter__ key whenever instructed to do so.*

*__Disable any antivirus__ or other memory-resident software before installing this or any other mod. Some (particularly avast and Norton!) have a tendency to report false positives with mod activity, resulting in failed installs.*

You can extract files from the archive using <a href="https://www.7-zip.org/download.html">7zip</a>, <a href="https://www.rarlab.com/download.htm">WinRAR</a>, <a href="https://zipgenius.com/">ZipGenius</a> or another file compression utility that handles .zip files.

## 

#### Special Note for Siege of Dragonspear from Steam/GOG

Good Old Games (GOG) and Steam both package the additional content for Siege of Dragonspear in a method that WeiDU, the tool used to install this mod, cannot access. You must run a program called <a href="https://github.com/Argent77/A7-DlcMerger/releases/latest">DLC Merger</a> on your SoD installation before you can install this or any other WeiDU-based mod.

## 

#### Enhanced Editions Note

The Enhanced Editions are actively supported games. Please note that every patch update will wipe your current mod setup! If in the middle of a modded game you might want to delay the patch update (if possible) as even after reinstalling the mods, you might not be able to continue with your old save games. Alternatively, copy the whole game's folder into a new one that can be modded and will stay untouched by game patches. It is important that you install the mod to the language version you are playing the game in. Otherwise, the dialogues of the mod will not show but give error messages.

## 

#### Windows

Bank of Baldur's Gate for Windows is distributed as an extractable compressed archive and includes a WeiDU installer.

Extract the contents of the mod archive into the folder of the game you wish to modify (*the folder which contains the "CHITIN.KEY" file*). On successful extraction, there should be a :file_folder: bank_of_baldurs_gate folder and a setup-bank_of_baldurs_gate.exe file in your game folder. To install, simply double-click **`setup-bank_of_baldurs_gate.exe`** and follow the instructions on screen.

Run **`setup-bank_of_baldurs_gate.exe`** in your game folder to reinstall, un-install or otherwise change components.

## 

#### Mac OS

Bank of Baldur's Gate for Mac OS is distributed in the same compressed archive and includes a WeiDU installer.

First, extract the files from the archive into your game directory. On successful extraction, there should be a :file_folder: bank_of_baldurs_gate folder, setup-bank_of_baldurs_gate and setup-bank_of_baldurs_gate.command files in your game folder. To install, simply double-click **`setup-bank_of_baldurs_gate.command`** and follow the instructions on screen.

Run **`setup-bank_of_baldurs_gate.command`** in your game folder to reinstall, un-install or otherwise change the components settings.

## 

#### Linux

Bank of Baldur's Gate for Linux is distributed in the same compressed archive and does not include a WeiDU installer.

Extract the contents of the mod to the folder of the game you wish to modify.

Download the latest version of WeiDU for Linux from <a href="https://github.com/WeiDUorg/weidu/releases">WeiDU.org</a> and copy weidu and weinstall to `/usr/bin`. Following that, open a terminal, **`cd`** to your game installation directory, run tolower and answer 'Y' to both queries. You can avoid running the second option (linux.ini) if you've already ran it once in the same directory. To save time, the archive is already tolowered, so there's no need to run the first option (lowercasing file names) either if you've extracted only this mod since the last time you lowercased file names. If you're unsure, running tolower and choosing both options is the safe bet.

To install, run **`weinstall setup-bank_of_baldurs_gate`** in your game folder. Then run **`wine bgmain.exe`** (or **`wine baldur.exe`** for EE games) and start playing.

## 

#### Note for Complete Un-installation

In addition to the methods above for removing individual components, you can completely un-install the mod using **`setup-bank_of_baldurs_gate --uninstall`** at the command line to remove all components without wading through prompts.<br>
